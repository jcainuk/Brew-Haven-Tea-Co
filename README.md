## Technologies Used

## Key Learnings

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

- **CSS Variables**: Using :root to store all my variables for reuse.
- **Floats**: Learning the fundamentals of floats for column layouts in order to understand legacy code.
- **CSS Animation and Transitions**: Incorporating CSS animations and transitions added a dynamic and engaging element to the website. Experimenting with keyframes, transforms, and transitions provided insights into how to create smooth and visually appealing animations to enhance user interactions.
- **Accessibility**: Making the website accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, was a priority. Implementing accessible design practices such as proper semantic markup, keyboard navigation, and aria attributes improved the website's usability and inclusivity..
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity and dynamic elements to enhance create the side menu.

## Future Considerations

The following features are potential ways to improve the project in the future:

- [ ] Connect the website to an existing API to generate the products
- [ ] Refactor the float layout with CSS grid or flexbox.
